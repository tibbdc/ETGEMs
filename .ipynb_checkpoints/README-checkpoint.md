# ETGEMs
The  scripts for construction of enzymatic and thermodynamic constrained GEMs in a single Pyomo modelling framework.

## Environment

The scripts were written and tested with Python 3.5.5. 

The core libraries essential for the pipeline including: 

1) Cobrapy toolkit: version --0.13.3 (recommend, because the latest version has removed a required function of "convert_to_irreversible")；

2) Pyomo package: version --5.7；

3) Gurobi solver: version --9.0.2;

In addition，the Pandas and related packages. 

## Software

The packages used to run the pipeline was listed in requirements.txt. To install the requirements using pip, run the following code at command-line:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create a stand-alone environment named ETGEMs with Python 3.5.5 and all the required package versions (especially for cobrapy is also available), run the following code:

```shell
$ conda create -n ETGEMs python=3.5.5
```
```shell
$ source activate ETGEMs
```
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
